# spectral draw
 
experimental painting app. made with LÃ–VE https://love2d.org/ (required to run)

instead of drawing in RGB, the visible spectrum is split up in 11 'bins'. 

the paint mixing is modeled using a simplified Kubelka-Munk theory.

see: http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~westin/pubs/kubelka.pdf

the spectral reflectance curves for each pigment is taken from:

it should support tablet input on windows (using wintab driver) but this feature is experimental.

for controls see `controls.txt`
